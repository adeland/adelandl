# Simon Chen - Portfolio Website

A modern, responsive portfolio website built with React and Vite, featuring custom animations, dynamic API integrations (GitHub contributions, Goodreads bookshelf, photo gallery, and contact form), hosted and served on **Cloudflare Pages & Workers**.

> **Note**: This README documents a migration from GitHub Pages. The site is served directly on **Cloudflare Pages & Workers** (worker logic + static assets).

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React 19.1.0, JavaScript (ES6+), Vite
- **Styling**: CSS3 with custom animations and dynamic Light/Dark mode themes
- **APIs & Workers**: Cloudflare Worker (`src/worker.js`) proxying:
  - `GET /api/github-contributions` for contribution graphs
  - `GET /api/goodreads` for the currently reading list
  - `GET /api/gallery` for the photo gallery manifest
  - `POST /api/contact` for the EmailJS contact form integration
- **Hosting**: Cloudflare Pages & Workers (`wrangler.jsonc`)

## 💻 Local Development

Prerequisites: [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 20+ (recommended).

### 1. Clone and Install
```bash
git clone https://github.com/shangmin-chen/simon-chen-website
cd simon-chen-website
npm install
```

### 2. Run the Vite Dev Server
```bash
npm run dev
```
This opens the frontend at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with hot-reloading.

### 3. Run the Cloudflare Worker Locally (Recommended)
To make sure dynamic features (GitHub contributions graph, Goodreads preview, photo gallery, and contact form submission) function correctly in your local environment, you need to run the worker locally in a second terminal:

1. **Set Up Local Secrets**: Copy `.dev.vars.example` to `.dev.vars` and add your EmailJS API keys:
   ```bash
   cp .dev.vars.example .dev.vars
   ```
2. **Start the Dev Worker**:
   ```bash
   npx wrangler dev
   ```
   *Alternatively, run the npm helper script: `npm run dev:worker` (which builds the frontend first and then starts the wrangler dev server).*
   
   The local worker runs on `http://127.0.0.1:8787`. The Vite dev server automatically proxies all `/api/*` calls from port `3000` to port `8787`.

## 📸 Image Gallery Optimization

The photo gallery is fed by `gallery.json` and loads assets hosted on Cloudflare R2. Before uploading raw images to R2, optimize them using the custom gallery resize script:

```bash
npm run gallery:resize -- <inputDir> <outputDir>
```
For example:
```bash
node scripts/resize-gallery.mjs ./my-raw-photos ./optimized-photos
```
This script uses [sharp](https://sharp.pixelplumbing.com/) to convert full-resolution images into optimized JPEG formats:
- `-full` images (max-width 1800px) for carousels and lightboxes.
- `-thumb` images (max-width 700px) for grid thumbnails.

After processing, upload the contents of `<outputDir>` to your Cloudflare R2 bucket and reference the filenames in `gallery.json`.

## 📧 EmailJS Setup

1. **Create an EmailJS Account** at [EmailJS](https://www.emailjs.com/) and set up an email service + template.
2. **Worker Environment Secrets**: Set `EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID`, `EMAILJS_TEMPLATE_ID`, and `EMAILJS_PUBLIC_KEY` as secrets on your Cloudflare Worker:
   ```bash
   npx wrangler secret put EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID
   npx wrangler secret put EMAILJS_TEMPLATE_ID
   npx wrangler secret put EMAILJS_PUBLIC_KEY
   ```
   For local testing, add these variables to `.dev.vars` (see `.dev.vars.example`).
3. **Origin Allowlist**: In your EmailJS dashboard, restrict allowed origins to your domain(s) for security.

## 🔧 Configuration

- **Dev Server Port**: Configured to `3000` in `vite.config.js` (`server.port`).
- **API Proxy**: During development, `/api` requests target the wrangler dev server on `http://127.0.0.1:8787` (configured in `vite.config.js`).

## 🚀 Deployment

Build the static files and deploy the Cloudflare Worker + static assets:

```bash
npm run deploy
```
This runs `vite build` followed by `wrangler deploy`. Ensure all environment secrets are set in your Cloudflare dashboard under the project settings.
